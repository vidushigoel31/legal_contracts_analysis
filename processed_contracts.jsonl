This document lists the minimum requirements for suppliers of [PARTY_B] Medical Solutions describing · how parts, components and systems are identified with their attributes and · how attributes are labeled both as plain text as well as barcode on products and its packaging. Detailed specifications with regards to the labeling of products are defined for the individual product concerned. 2 Definitions and abbreviations 2.1 Material No. The [PARTY_B] Medical Solutions Material No. is used to uniquely identify products (parts, components and systems). It consists of an 8-digit identification no. assigned by [PARTY_B] Medical Solutions. Previously, the term \"Part no.\" was also used; it is replaced by the term \"Material No.\". 2.2 Revision The Revision (abbreviated \"Rev.\") serves to distinguish between different update statuses of hardware. It is assigned by [PARTY_B] Medical Solutions. The English term \"Revision\" replaces the German term \"Erzeugnisstand\" (abbreviated \"ES\") and \"Ausführungsstand\" (abbreviated \"AS\"). 2.3 Serial No. The Serial No. is an identifying attribute used to uniquely identify hardware or software with the same Material No. . For suppliers the Serial No. can consist of up to 15 alphanumeric digits; it is however recommended to use only a 6 digit numerical Serial No. where possible. The Serial No. may contain a dash (-) or a slash (/), but no other special characters (e.g. # + * ?). Spaces, lower case letters or language-specific characters (e.g. Ä, Ö, Ü) are not allowed within the Serial No. . The characters \"L\", \"Sxx L\" or \"Sxx\" at the end or the beginning of the Serial No. should be avoided (xx = any alphanumerical character). For any Serial No. that is numeric only (i.e. has no letters) it is allowed to omit printing of leading zeros (\"0\"). It is recommended to use the Serial No. of the supplier if it complies with the principles described above. 2.4 Data Identifier Data Identifiers are used in the barcode to indicate that the information following the Data Identifier is data of a certain attribute. The Data Identifier enables the barcode reading program to recognize that the following information represents a certain type of attribute. Data Identifiers to be used: 3\n\n1P Material No. 2P Revision (for packaging only) S Serial No. Q Quantity (for packaging only) 14D Expiration date (for packaging only) T Batch (for packaging only)"}

Is no batch provided on the packing but required, a batch is initiated in the stock. 2.7 Shelf life If a shelf life is defined for parts the shelf life has to be filed in calendar days. (365 days per year) 3 Reference documents n/a 4 Requirements 4.1 Identification of parts, components and systems Non-serialized parts (including spare parts) and components are identified using a Material No. . If necessary, different statuses of a part, component or system can be distinguished via the Revision. Serialized parts, components and systems are identified using the combination of Material No. and Serial No. . In addition, the Revision may be used to distinguish between different statuses of hardware. 4.2 Labeling of parts, components, systems and its packaging In general, requirements with respect to labeling have to be defined for the product concerned. However, minimum requirements are specified in order to allow proper identification throughout all processes involved. This chapter lists those minimum requirements. For all material numbers specified by [PARTY_B] the parts and its packaging have to be labeled according to the requirements listed below. The label depends on whether a part/component/system · is serialized · contains a revision level · is classified as an IVK (\"Installed Volume Component\") · shall be handled by expiration date or batch [PARTY_B] defines those requirements per individual Material No. .\n5\n\nColor Usually white label with black printing other colors are allowed as long as barcode/plain text can be read Barcode content 1P <Material No. > S <Serial No.> Additionally for packaging only 2P <product Revision> Q <quantity of products in this packaging (numeric only), usually 1> It is not allowed to label Revision and Quantity on product identification labels! e.g.: 1P01234567 as barcode *) (1P) Model No. 01234567 S1001 as barcode *) (S) Serial No. 1001\n\nEach symbol structure with start and stop character including Data Identifier (e.g. \"1P\" or \"S\"), but without symbol check character.

(Nasdaq: AIMT), a biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies, today announced it has obtained an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize the investigational humanized monoclonal antibody Xm Ab®7195 from Xencor, Inc.\n\nXm Ab7195, which has been renamed AIMab7195, was originally developed by Xencor for the treatment of allergic asthma. It uses three distinct mechanisms of action to reduce blood serum Ig E and suppress Ig E-producing cells. Aimmune initially plans to develop AIMab7195 as an adjunctive treatment with select Characterized Oral Desensitized Immuno Therapy (CODIT™) programs, including PALFORZIA™ , to explore treatment outcomes in patients with food allergies.\n\n\"As we look to the future of food allergy treatments, we are excited to explore the potential of oral immunotherapy to achieve greater levels of desensitization - and perhaps even remission - when combined with adjunctive biologics that target immune pathways,\" said Jayson Dallas, M. D., President and CEO of Aimmune. \"In-licensing AIMab7195 demonstrates our commitment to enriching our pipeline and strengthening Aimmune's global leadership in the evolving therapeutic landscape of food allergy treatments.\"\n\n\"Aimmune's focus, clinical success and regulatory expertise in food allergy demonstrate their capability to advance AIMab7195 with highly complementary CODIT pipeline programs to create new options for people living with food allergy,\" said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph. D., President and CEO of Xencor. \"AIMab7195 is designed to reduce levels of Ig E, a key mediator of allergic response, and there is strong scientific rationale that this reduction would synergize with the activity of desensitization therapies.\""}

Should any dispute, claim or controversy arise between the Parties relating to the validity, interpretation, existence, performance, termination or breach of this Agreement (collectively, a \"Dispute\"), the Parties shall use their best efforts to resolve the Dispute by good faith negotiations, first between their respective representatives directly involved in that Dispute and the Alliance Managers for a period of thirty (30) days, and then, if necessary, between vice presidents of the Parties for an additional fifteen (15) days, and then, if necessary, between Chief Executive Officers of the Parties for an additional five (5) Business Days. Any such Dispute not satisfactorily settled by negotiation in accordance with the foregoing process, either Party may submit such Dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with subsection (a) below; provided that nothing in this Section 19.2 will preclude either Party from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with Section (a) below.\n\n(a) Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Venue. Each Party hereto agrees that any action, proceeding or claim it commences against the other Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be brought\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nin the courts of the United States for the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment.

Each Party agrees that a final non-appealable judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding in such a court shall be conclusive and binding and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law.\n\n(b) Waiver of Jury Trial. Due to the high costs and time involved in commercial litigation before a jury, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY AND ALL ISSUES IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n19.3 Injunctive Relief. Each Party acknowledges that its breach of its obligations under this Agreement may result in immediate and irreparable harm to the other Party, for which there may be no adequate remedy at law.

Such right to injunctive relief as provided for in this paragraph is in addition to, and is not in limitation of, whatever remedies either Party may be entitled to as a matter of law or equity, including money damages.

Co-Host shall be permitted to maintain on the Online Service Page (as defined in Part 2 of Exhibit \"A\") of the Originating Locations in the manner set forth on Exhibit \"B\" hereto (and on such other positions as are set forth on Exhibit \"B\" or as the parties may mutually agree upon in writing from time to time) a hot link to Internet locations specified by the Co-Host (the \"Destination\") from which Goods (other than Competitor's Goods (hereinafter defined)) may be sold. The web pages at the Destination shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement, including without limitation, Section 2 hereof. \"Competitor's Goods\" as used herein shall mean the Goods of any of the persons or entities described on Part 1 of Exhibit \"C\" attached hereto and made a part hereof. The Destination shall not contain any links to any third party sites for the purchase of Competitor's Goods; provided that the Destination will link to the Co-Host Site (which will sell Competitor's Goods).\n\n(b) Exclusive Positioning. Co-Host shall be the exclusive reseller of software products (\"Software\") at the Originating Locations. The preceding sentence shall not prohibit NAI from (i) reselling Software including NAI Goods (hereinafter defined) from the Mc Afee Mall; (ii) referencing and linking to sites of strategic partners (other than competitors of Co-Host listed on Part 2 of Exhibit \"C\") which may also be involved in the resale of Software from such sites; provided that no Software may be purchased on the page of such site which is linked to any Originating Location and further provided that the references and links to the sites of strategic partners shall not be placed on the Online Service Page; and (iii) advertising Software with banners, buttons and other forms of online advertising; provided that any link from such advertising takes the end user to the publisher of the Software and not a reseller of Goods (other than Co-Host). For example, an advertising banner or button for the Windows 98 software program may link back to the website of Microsoft Corporation but not the website of Dell Computer Corporation which is reselling the program. Without limitation on the foregoing, NAI may co-host a comparative shopping service on the Originating Locations. NAI will obtain a written covenant that the comparative shopping co-host will present sellers of Software in a neutral manner and upon request of Co-Host will require removal or alteration of presentations by such co-host on such co-hosted facility which Co-Host reasonably deems to be non-neutral; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Co-Host may be the featured or most prominent Software reseller on any such service.\n\n(c) Short Term Product Exclusives. For a period of fourteen (14) days following release of any new NAI Goods or major version releases (i.e., version 3.0 to 4.0) of existing NAI Goods, Co-Host shall be the exclusive online seller of any such\n\n3 4\n\nrelease released during the Term. \"NAI Goods\" as used herein shall mean retail desktop software products offered by NAI under the \"Mc Afee\" brand or other NAI owned brand, which NAI makes available for resale through distributors and resellers via the Internet.\n\n(d) Reference Site. Co-Host may refer to the Originating Locations as a Co-Host [PARTY_C] location and to NAI as a Co-Host [PARTY_C] hereunder provided all such references shall be subject to the prior review and approval of NAI, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld."}

Co-Host may refer to the Originating Locations as a Co-Host [PARTY_C] location and to NAI as a Co-Host [PARTY_C] hereunder provided all such references shall be subject to the prior review and approval of NAI, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n(e) Links to Online Service Page.

Any end user accessing a \"buy\" button on any of the Originating Locations shall be taken to the Online Service Page. NAI shall not sell retail desktop consumer products, including without limitation, NAI Goods from the NAI Internet Sites (other than the Mc Afee Mall).\n\nNAI reserves the right to change the URL of the Originating Locations from time to time and agrees to give Co-Host as much notice of any such change as is practicable.\n\n=== 2.

Co-Host shall comply with all applicable laws in connection with the operation of the Destination, including without limitation, requirements regarding the confidentiality of information concerning end users. NAI retains the right, but not the obligation, to disapprove or remove any advertisements or advertising materials it reasonably deems illegal, inappropriate or otherwise inconsistent with the purposes of the Originating Sites, without the consent of Co-Host.\n\n(c) Use of Trademarks. Co-Host hereby grants to NAI a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license during the term of this Agreement to use the trademarks, service marks and trade names of Co-Host in connection with the advertising and promotion of the Goods from the Originating Locations, provided that NAI complies with the terms of Section 9(b) of the Web Site Services Agreement (as defined below). Co-Host reserves the right to terminate the foregoing right, after giving NAI notice and opportunity to cure the allegedly harmful use, if in Co-Host's reasonable judgment, NAI's use of such trademarks, service marks and trade names harms the business, image or goodwill of Co-Host.\n\n4 5\n\n(d) Limited Duty of Promotion. NAI shall have no duty or obligation to advertise or promote the Goods, other than as set forth in this Section 2.

NAI reserves the right to cease publication of the Originating Locations for brief periods from time to time for maintenance or other purposes; provided that the Originating Locations will comply with the same \"Uptime Requirements\" specified with respect to the \"Managed Site\" in the Web Site Services Agreement.\n\n(e) Marketing Promotions. During the Term, Co-Host and NAI will regularly discuss and implement mutually agreed upon jointly funded marketing promotions. NAI and Co-Host hereby agree that the marketing promotions set forth on Exhibit \"D\" hereto will be implemented as set forth on Exhibit \"D\".\n\n(f) Distribution of Physical Products.

If the Parties agree in good faith that it is appropriate to bring an opposition, action for declaratory judgment, nullity action, interference, declaration for non-infringement, re- examination or other attack upon the validity, title or enforceability of a patent owned or controlled by a Third Party based on its' potential adverse impact on the patent freedom-to-operate with respect to the Commercialization of a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory, then Cyto Dyn shall control such action and shall be responsible for the costs of such action. Cyto Dyn shall provide Vyera with copies of any substantive documents related to such proceedings and reasonable notice of all such proceedings. Vyera may itself or through its counsel offer comments and suggestions with respect to the matters that are the subject of this Section 8.7 and Cyto Dyn shall consider such comments and suggestions in good faith. If the Parties disagree in good faith as to whether it is reasonable to enter into a license agreement with a Third Party to avoid infringement by the sale, offer for sale or use of a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory and such Third Party subsequently brings an infringement action (or an infringement action is brought on its behalf) that is solely related to the sale, offer for sale or use of a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory, then the Party that did not agree to pursuing the Required Third Party License will be responsible for all costs, fees and damages incurred in connection with such infringement action in the event and to the extent any such infringement action is solely related to the sale, offer for sale or use of a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory, and the provisions of Section 13.2 shall not apply if Vyera is the Party that did not agree to pursue such Required Third Party License solely for the sale, offer for sale or use of a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory."}

(d) Settlement. If an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Claim, no compromise or settlement of such Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnitee's written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee's consent shall not be required of a settlement where: (i) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnitee; (ii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; (iii) the Indemnitee's rights under this Agreement are not adversely affected; and (iv) there is a full release of the Indemnitee from such Claim. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume defense of a Claim within a reasonable time, the Indemnitee may settle such Claim on such terms as it deems appropriate with the consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee for such settlement as provided in this Article 13.

If users choose this feature (usually done during subscription registration and payment), they will be sent the new table of contents for each journal to which they have subscribed. This feature will be available to both subscribers as well as non-subscribing users.\n\nThis scenario shows what a user can do after receiving an emailed version of the table of contents. The scenario has two parts: one for text-based email, the other for HTML enabled email.\n\nText Email\n\n=== 1. Receipt of email announcement: User receives an email message and opens it in their email reader. ===\n\n=== 2. Table of contents listing: The message contains the table of contents of the newly published issue of the journal. ===\n\n=== 3.

Some example sets are: All Full Text Journals, All Subscribed Journals, and Journals by particular Publisher. Searches that return a single document will forward the user to the abstract or full text if they have access to the full text.\n\nThe following scenarios outline several ways in which a subscriber may search for content. In addition to offering different types of searching mechanisms (i.e., \"quick searches\" through advanced searches), users will also be able to access the searching capability from various areas of the site. The following scenarios outline some of the search possibilities.\n\nQuick Search\n\nA \"Quick Search\" enables the user to search on a topic (e.g., insulin pumps) and obtain a listing of areas where this topic is cited.\n\n=== 1. From custom page: From the custom page, users would enter a keyword or phrase in the quick search box. The user would select the All Subscribed journal set, and then submit the query. ===\n\n=== 2. Results: The search returns a listing of all articles; each linked to the full text, PDF, and the abstract where available. ===\n\n=== 3. Save Query: On the results page, the user would have the option of saving the query. This adds the query to the user's customized page. ===\n\nSearching Full Text\n\nAnother option is to search the entire full text of a document for specific terms. The following is a sample of how this search could be conducted from the user's custom page.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING\n\nUSER SCENARIOS [PARTY_C] HELP - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n=== 1.

In addition, the entries that the user has subscription access to would be noted. Results can be ordered by relevancy, date, author and journal title. ===\n\nThe user has the ability to save the query.\n\nFinding an Article Cited Elsewhere\n\nThis scenario provides the user with Health Gate's Citation Finder Technology. It allows a subscriber the ability to quickly locate the abstract (and the full text if available) from a bibliographic reference.\n\n=== 1. Access from custom page: From the registered subscriber's customized page, s/he selects the Citation Finder option. The Citation Finder page is pre-loaded and has a field for entry of the citation. The user can either input the citation information or \"copy and paste\" it into the appropriate fields. The Citation Finder does not require information in all fields to execute a search successfully. ===\n\n=== 2. Search criteria: The user then selects the fields, or information, which s/he wants to search. Examples of these fields include author, journal name, year, volume, issue, article title, and all fields. For this example, the user selects author, article title, and journal name. ===\n\n=== 3. Results: The user submits the query. If an exact match is found, the abstract will be provided. If not, the user is presented with a list of matches from which to select. ===\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [PARTY_C] Help - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlackwell/Munksgaard will have administrative access to these features. All access will be recorded to monitor any possible abuse.\n\nForgotten Password\n\nWhen a user forgets his/her password, the system provides a mechanism for the user to look up and find their password without calling [PARTY_C] service. This scenario shows how that is accomplished: 1. On the login page, a user who has forgotten their password selects the link \"forgotten password.\"\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING\n\nUSER SCENARIOS [PARTY_C] HELP - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n=== 2.

Pull extracts: For pull extracts (extracts that require someone to pull the content off the journal server), a user will have to enter the user name and password that the third party will use to retrieve the content. ===\n\n=== 4. Tape based abstracts: Tape based abstracts will be handled similar to FTP pulls except that they would be loaded to tape and sent via postal service. ===\n\nAbstracts Only (Headers)\n\nSome [PARTY_C]s want the abstracts only. This will allow bibliographic database to receive the information in electronic form rather than having to re-key the documents. Ideally, all databases would also receive information pointing them to the full text version of the documents. The directory structure will also be included with this abstract. It is possible to create a different directory structure and will have to be handled on an ad-hoc basis.\n\nThis scenario will be completed upon the supply of the final version of the Blackwell/Munksgaard DTD.\n\nAbstracts and PDF (Headers and PDF)\n\nThis type of export would use the same DTD as the abstracts only, but would include a reference to the PDF file inside each header.

An essential requirement of the PHS Policy, http://grants2. nih. gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol. htm is that every institution using live vertebrate animals must obtain an approved assurance from OLAW before they can receive funding from any component of the U. S. Public Health Service.\n\nThe PHS Policy requires that Assured institutions base their programs of animal care and use on the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals http://www. nap. edu/readingroom/books/labrats/ and that they comply with the regulations (9 C. F. R., subchapter A) http://www. nal. usda. gov/awic/legislat/usdaleg1. htm issued by the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) under the Animal Welfare Act.

The PHS Policy stipulates that an applicant organization, whether domestic or foreign, bears responsibility for the humane care and use of animals in PHS-supported research activities. Also the PHS policy defines \"animal\" as \"any live, vertebrate animal used, or intended for use, in research, research training, experimentation, biological testing or for related purposes.\" This policy implements and supplements the U. S. Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research, and Training, and requires that institutions use the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as a basis for developing and implementing an institutional animal care use program. This Policy does not affect applicable State or local laws or regulations that impose more stringent standards for the care and use of laboratory animals. All institutions are required to comply, as applicable, with the Animal Welfare Act, as amended and other Federal statutes and regulations relating to animals. These documents are available from the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, (301) 496-7163. http://grants. nih. gov/grants/olaw/olaw. htm.\n\nNo PHYS supported work or research involving vertebrate animals will be conducted by an organization, unless that organization is operating in accordance with an approved Animal Welfare Assurance and provides verification that the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) has reviewed and approved the proposed activity in accordance with the PHS policy. Applications may be referred by the PHS back to the institution for further review in the case of an apparent or potential violations of the PHS policy. No award to an individual will be made unless that individual is affiliated with an assured organization that accepts responsibility for compliance with the PHS Policy. Foreign applicant organizations applying for PHS awards for activities involving vertebrate animals are required to comply with PHS Policy or provide evidence that acceptable standards for the humane care and use of animals will be met. Foreign applicant organizations are not required to submit IACUC approval, but should provide information that is satisfactory to the Government to provide assurances for the humane care of such animals.\n\nH.21: Approval of Required Assurance by OLAW"}

We are in the business of franchising others to operate \"Pizza Fusion\" restaurant businesses, which feature a competitively priced menu of organic and all-natural gourmet pizza and related food specialties, and standards and methods of operation designed to be \"green,\" and which are operated in buildings that bear our interior and/or exterior trade dress (each a \"Restaurant\" or \"Franchised Business\"). B. We have developed a distinctive set of specifications and operating procedures (collectively, the \"System\") for Restaurants. The distinguishing characteristics of the System include: dough, sauce, and other recipes and products that are prepared or manufactured in accordance with our proprietary and/or secret recipes, trade secrets, standards, and specifications that we deem secret (\"Secret Recipe Products\") and other designated and approved products; standards and procedures for business operations, including \"green\" design, construction, and operating practices; equipment layouts, graphics packages and signage, distinctive interior and exterior design and accessories, quality and uniformity of products and services offered; procedures for management and inventory control; training and assistance; advertising and promotional programs; and [PARTY_C] development and service techniques.

You understand the importance of our high standards of quality, appearance, and service and the necessity of operating your Franchised Business in accordance with this Agreement and our standards, specifications and procedures.

If we cannot reasonably be expected to furnish the same consideration as the third-party, then we may substitute the reasonable equivalent in cash. If the parties cannot agree within 30 days on the reasonable equivalent in cash, we will designate, at our expense, an independent appraiser and the appraiser's determination will be final. Any material change in the terms of the offer from a third-party after we have elected not to purchase the seller's interest will constitute a new offer subject to the same right of first refusal as the third party's initial offer. 14.8.2. If a Transfer is proposed to be made by gift, we will designate, at our expense, an independent appraiser to determine the fair market value of the interest proposed to be transferred. We may purchase the interest at the fair market value determined by the appraiser. Closing on the purchase will occur within 30 days after our notice to the transferor of the appraiser's determination of fair market value. 14.8.3. If we elect not to exercise our rights under this Section, the transferor may complete the Transfer after complying with Sections 14.2 [No Transfer without Our Prior Written Consent] through 14.6 [Transfer upon Death or Incapacity] above. Closing of the Transfer must occur within 60 calendar days of our election (or such longer period as applicable law may require); otherwise, the third-party's offer will be treated as a new offer subject to our right of first refusal. The Transfer is conditional upon our determination that the Transfer was on terms substantially the same as those offered to us. 15. TERMINATION 15.1. Termination By Us Without Notice. You will be in default under this Agreement and all rights granted by this Agreement will automatically terminate without notice to you if you become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of your creditors; if a receiver is appointed; if execution is levied against your business assets; or if suit to foreclose any lien or mortgage or bankruptcy is instituted against you and not dismissed within 60 days.

Liquidated Damages. 16.5.1 The payments called for in Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above constitute liquidated damages for causing the premature termination of this Agreement and not a penalty. A precise calculation of the full extent of damages that we will incur if this Agreement terminates because you default cannot be reasonably determined. Nevertheless, the parties agree that the lump-sum payment provided under Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above is reasonable in light of the damages for premature termination that may reasonably be expected to occur in such event. 16.5.2 The amounts contemplated under Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above is not a penalty and is intended by the parties only as a compensatory remedy for past breaches and not as a preventative remedy to deter future breaches. Neither does the sum contemplated in Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above represent a price for the privilege of not performing or its payment represent an alternative manner of performance. Accordingly, as a purely liquidated damage provision, this Section does not preclude, nor is inconsistent with, a court granting us specific performance or any other equitable remedies, such as an injunction, to prevent future breaches. Our rights to liquidated damages and specific performance or any other equitable relief are not mutually exclusive. 16.6. Enforcement Costs. You agree to pay all damages, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, that we incur (even if after the expiration or termination of this Agreement) in enforcing this Section 16 or Section 17.2 [After Termination, Expiration, or Transfer] below. 17.

CONSTRUCTION OF THE AGREEMENT, SEVERABILITY, AND SURVIVAL 23.1. Clauses are Severable. Each provision of this Agreement is severable from the others. If, for any reason, any provision is determined by a court to be invalid, the invalidity will not impair the operation of the remaining provisions of this Agreement. The latter will continue to be given full force and effect and bind us and you. 23.2. Survival of Clauses. Each provision of this Agreement that expressly or by reasonable implication is to be performed, in whole or in part, after the expiration, termination, or Transfer of this Agreement will survive such expiration, termination, or Transfer. 23.3 Force Majeure. If the performance of any obligation by any party under this Agreement is prevented, hindered or delayed by reason of Force Majeure, which cannot be overcome by reasonable commercial measures, then the parties shall be relieved of their respective obligations (but only to the extent, that the parties, having exercised best efforts, are prevented, hindered or delayed in such performance) during the period of such Force Majeure. The party whose performance is affected by an event of Force Majeure shall give prompt written notice in the circumstances of such Force Majeure event to the other party by describing the nature of the event and an estimate as to its duration, if possible. As used in this Agreement, the term \"Force Majeure\" means any act of God, strike, lock out or other industrial disturbance, terrorist act, war (declared or undeclared), riot, epidemic, fire or other catastrophe, or act of any government. However, your inability to obtain financing or make payments (regardless of the reason) does not constitute \"Force Majeure.\" 23.4 Cover Page, Recitals, and Captions. The parties agree to incorporate by reference, and include in the text of this Agreement, the information on the cover page and in the recital paragraphs. The parties also agree that all of the captions in this Agreement are meant only for the convenience of the parties, and none of the captions shall be deemed to affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement. 23.5 No Third Party Rights. Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement is intended (nor shall be deemed) to confer upon any party any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, except for you, us, and such of our respective successors and assigns as may be contemplated (and, as to you, permitted) by Sections 13 and 14 above. 24.

DISPUTES 25.1. Submission to Mediation. Except as otherwise provided in Section 25.7below, any controversy or claim arising between us will first be submitted to non-binding mediation administered by an established, neutral mediation service with experience in franchise disputes. Both parties must sign a confidentiality agreement before participating in any mediation proceeding. The mediation will take place in the city where our principal offices are located at the time the demand for mediation is filed. Once either party has submitted a dispute to mediation, the obligation to attend will be binding on both parties. Each party will bear its own costs with respect to the mediation. The fee for the mediation, however, will be split equally. 25.2. Forum for Litigation. You and the Owners must file any suit against us, and we may file any suit against you, in the federal or state court where our principal office is located at the time the suit is filed.
